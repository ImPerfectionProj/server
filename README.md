## Database Set up
We use MongoDB to store our fake data. The location of the data is in Organization "MyProjects" under Project "imperfection." We use free Atlas.
In the future, you may want to set up your own organization and project to manage the dataset. 

Please take a look at this instruction to get started: https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/.
